# Product Description

Imagine you are a student with the stress of approaching exams. You want to head into university to study, but every exam season the libraries become full to bursting with your like-minded peers; you aren&#39;t sure you will be able to find a free chair. Every time you&#39;ve tried this week you have wasted half an hour going from library to library before giving up and heading home.

Enter FindADesk, an application which allows students to easily find and book available desks across their university&#39;s study spaces, taking away the stress of having to search manually and not knowing whether your search will be fruitful. For university administrators, use FindADesk to better manage study spaces so they can be used more efficiently, while also receiving live information about desk usage across every space in your institution.
